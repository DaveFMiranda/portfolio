        I recently finished a six-month full-stack development course at the University of Kansas. I'm seeking an entry-level back-end developer position in which I can eventually build on my previous work experience. I have writing skills developed over ten years of working in corporate and political public relations. I also have management and leadership skills developed over the course of managing and winning political campaigns for seven election seasons. I've built and trained teams from scratch, managed six-figure budgets, and led organizations to victory under the demanding and unforgiving conditions set by an immovable project deadline: Election Day.
